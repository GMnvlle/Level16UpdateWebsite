PROJECT TITLE: Level16updateWebsite
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: A website I created about the level 16 update in Clash Royale. This an index.html file that you can run locally. I specifically designed it intending for it to be used on linux with apache. This was a project that allowed me to learn how to use html, and how to run a website locally.
VERSION or DATE: December 2025
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: On linux, unzip the file to the /var/www/html folder. Then in your browser, you are able to look up http://"your host IP" and the website will pop up.
